# Cobonkoi Games

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a website created for Cobonkoi Games, an indie games development company that are currently developing their first game.
The website includes information on the company/employees, the game that is currently being developed and contact information should you wish to get in touch.
In addition it allows you to sign up for the alpha testing of "Hard Brexit", and a monthly newsletter.

The goals of the website are to:
 - Build awareness of Cobonkoi Games
 - Provide information about the games created by Cobonkoi Games
 - Provide information on the progress of games in development
 - Get people to sign up to Alpha Testing
 - Get people to sign up to the Newsletter

## Demo

A demo can be viewed on Github Pages [here](https://cobonkoi.github.io/cobonkoi-games/).
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

My goal was to provide a simple design for the website to provide lots of information in small, easily digestible chunks.
To do this I have made the navigation easy to understand. Each section on the pages are clearly titled and seperate from one another.

The website is for people who would like to know more about Cobonkoi Games and/or the games they develop. Also for people who wish to become alpha testers for them.

#### User Stories

1. As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to easily navigate the site, so that I can find what I want easily.
2. As a new visitor to the site, I want to see the games this company has created, to see if they are worth purchasing.
3. As an interested Alpha tester, I want to sign-up to become a tester, so that I can begin testing games.
4. As a person interested in Cobonkoi Games, I want to learn more about the company, so that I can decide whether to support them further.
5. As a person interested in Cobonkoi Games, I want to learn how I can contact them, so that I can receive further information.
6. As a person interested in Hard Brexit, I want to learn more about the game, so that I can decide whether I would like to purchase it on release.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
Each page features an alert that will only appear on larger screen sizes, this provides information about Hard Brexit Alpha testing and a link for more information.
Each page features a navigation bar that is responsive to screen sizes. This contains links to each other page, as well as the company name in the top left.
Each page features a footer which contains links to 5 social media pages for the company.

#### Home
This page features a large carousel with 2 slides on it. This has indicators on the bottom to show which slide you are currently on. 
On larger screens it features navigation arrows to switch between the slides, these are removed on mobile due to being too obstructive.

Slide 1 features a a little information about the game Hard Brexit, as well as a button to sign up to the Alpha.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. JQuery

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
